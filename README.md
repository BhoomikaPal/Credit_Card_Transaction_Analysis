## Insights (As per Sample Data)

- **Peak Usage Hours:** 3 PM â€“ 5 PM consistently had the highest transaction amounts, indicating strong afternoon engagement.
- **Spending Spikes:** Notable high-activity days (e.g., July 5, Dec 20) likely align with sales or festive periods.
- **Widespread Usage:** Multiple unique users transacting at peak times suggests broad engagement, not just high-value users.
- **Stable Patterns:** Hourly behavior trends remained consistent across both years.
