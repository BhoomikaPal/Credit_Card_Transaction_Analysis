-**`Create a SQL and Python code to`**:
- a) Calculate: total_transactions, unique_users and total_transaction_amount for every date and hour combination.
- b) Calculate hour with highest transaction_amount for every date

## How to Navigate

## Insights (As per Sample Data)

- **Peak Usage Hours:** 3 PM â€“ 5 PM consistently had the highest transaction amounts, indicating strong afternoon engagement.
- **Spending Spikes:** Notable high-activity days (e.g., July 5, Dec 20) likely align with sales or festive periods.
- **Widespread Usage:** Multiple unique users transacting at peak times suggests broad engagement, not just high-value users.
- **Stable Patterns:** Hourly behavior trends remained consistent across both years.

- Behavior-Based Personalization: To increase engagement by sending reminders or offers when a user typically transacts.
- Dashboard for Business Leaders: To help decision-makers track performance.
- Spend Forecasting (Hourly/Daily): To anticipate high-volume periods and optimize campaign timing.
